# Malicious Chromium extensions

The aim of this repository is to produce a list of all malicious extension IDs and where they were disclosed.
If the extension is listed but was vulnerable then this can lead to false positives.
Please assess any detections before flagging them as definitely malicious (the reference should help!)

Pull requests are welcome, simply add a link to the end of the sources.txt file and then run the script. This will produce a fresh copy of the CSV and you can ppull req with the whole directory
